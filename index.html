<h1>Spring Drips Out Now</h1>

<h1>NEWS</h1>

<p> Dan Taro has found his voice on Spring Drips. This is the first full-length release from the Denver-based artist. The album shows the tenacity and focus of Taroâ€™s musical career.
 <p>
   <p>
Spring Drips started in the summer of 2014 when Taro decided to create a band to bridge the gap between cold electronic sounds and human warmth. Over the course of that year, Taro spent each morning creating the foundation for the album. Through experimentation, songs began to take shape around bass lines, rhythms, or the timbres of different instruments.

   <p>
Over sessions with Nate Ball, the resident drummer of the project, the two worked tirelessly recording in three different studios over the course of the next three and a half years. Other long-time friends made appearances in various songs to add another layer to the album.
 <p>
All this culminated in the massive, sprawling, and complex work that is Spring Drips.
